# Search Photos from Usplash

# A React Native chat app

This is an application that you can enter a keyword and view images that match the keyword.

- Entering and submitting a keyword should result in a collection of images that you can scroll through
- Updating the search keyword and resubmitting should replace the collection of images with those returned by the new search.
- You should be able to "Pin" images so that they remain in the collection. When updating your search keyword, the pinned images should remain even if they arenâ€™t returned in the new search.
- You should be able to unpin pinned images.
